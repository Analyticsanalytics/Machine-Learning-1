# Machine Learning:

This repository consist of the following projects:

## Predictive Analytics Service
This project exposes the various machine learning models (Classifier, Recommender System, Topic Modeling, Text Summarization, Forecasting Trends,etc) as web service(rest). Its shows how to deploy & use machine learning in production after the model is build, validated and evaluated.


## Mahout Analytics
This projects contains the Recommender system ,Classification and Clustering example with Apache Mahout.


## Churn Analytics
The goal of churn analytics project is to understand the primary drivers to churn and predict
churn using R and Apache Mahout.


## Machine Learning with R
Real world examples of Machine Learning :

a) Regression
b) Classification
c) Nearest Neighbor
d) Boosting
e) Feature Engineering 
f) Time Series forecasting


## Machine Learning with Python ()
Real world examples of Machine Learning using (Sci-kit Learn, GraphLab) :

a) Regression 
b) Deep Learning [Image classification & similar Image Retrieval], 
c) Classification

f) Churn Analytics

Also some basic web scraping using Beautiful Soup.


## Natural Language Processing
Some commonly used examples of NLP using OpenNLP, StanfordCoreNLP, LingPipe, Mallet and Carrot :

a) Tokenizer
b) Name Finder
c) Sentence Detection
d) Sentiment Analysis
e) POS Detection
f) Topic Modeling


## Mini Watson
This project is a part of lab exercise done during the course "Analyzing Big Data with a Concept IBM Watson" from Big Data University. Its a simple Question Answering system using OpenNLP.


## Coursera-008
This contains the programming exercise of the Coursera Machine Learning course (ML008- https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) from Stanford University by Prof. Andrew NG.
