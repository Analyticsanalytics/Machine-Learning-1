Creating Sequenc Files from Command
mahout seqdirectory -i $WORK_DIR/original -o $WORK_DIR/sequencesfiles

To look at the generated file we could use the following seqdumper command:
mahout seqdumper -i $WORK_DIR/sequencesfiles/chunk-0 | more

We need to now transform all these files into Hadoop sequence files. To do this, you need to just type the following command:
./mahout seqdirectory -i ${WORK_DIR}/20news-all -o ${WORK_DIR}/20news-seq

To examine the outcome, you can use the Hadoop command-line option fs . So, for example, if you would like to see what is in the chunck-0 file, you could type in the following command:
hadoop fs -text $WORK_DIR/20news-seq/chunck-0 | more


We need to transform the raw text into vectors of weights and frequency. To do this, we type in the following command:

./mahout seq2sparse -i ${WORK_DIR}/20news-seq -o ${WORK_DIR}/20news-vectors -lnorm -nv -wt tfidf


The following command parameters are described briefly:
The -lnorm parameter instructs the vector to use the L_2 norm as a distance
The -nv parameter is an optional parameter that outputs the vector as namedVector
The -wt parameter instructs which weight function needs to be used


A good dividing percentage is shown to be 80 percent and 20 percent, meaning that the training data should be 80 percent of the total while the testing ones should be the remaining
20 percent.To split data, we use the following command:

./mahout split
-i ${WORK_DIR}/20news-vectors/tfidf-vectors
--trainingOutput ${WORK_DIR}/20news-train-vectors
--testOutput ${WORK_DIR}/20news-test-vectors
--randomSelectionPct 40 --overwrite --sequenceFiles -xm sequential


As result of this command, we will have two new folders containing the training and testing
vectors. Now, it is time to train our Na√Øves Bayes algorithm on the training set of vectors, and
the command that is used is pretty easy:
./mahout trainnb
-i ${WORK_DIR}/20news-train-vectors -el
-o ${WORK_DIR}/model
-li ${WORK_DIR}/labelindex
-ow

Once finished, we have our training model ready to be tested against the remaining 20
percent of the initial input vectors. The final console command is as follows:

./mahout testnb
-i ${WORK_DIR}/20news-test-vectors
-m ${WORK_DIR}/model
-l ${WORK_DIR}/labelindex\
-ow -o ${WORK_DIR}/20news-testing
